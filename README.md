Volatility Bands extends the concept of Keltner Channels by incorporating three pairs of bands calculated using ATR and EMA. These include standard ATR bands, customizable offset bands, and additional outer bands for extended volatility analysis.

For usage, you can download the zip in the release page. You can import this zip file similar to importing a normal NinjaTrader Add-On. https://github.com/WaleeTheRobot/volatility-bands/releases
